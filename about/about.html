            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Our restaurant began as a small dream shared by a few friends who
                believed that food should be an experience—not just a plate. A place
                you walk into and instantly feel at home: the aromas, the colors, and
                the presentation all familiar and comforting.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have poured care into every detail—from the soft background music to
                how each dish is served—so everything carries a sense of warmth. We
                preserved the authentic flavors we grew up with, and presented them in a
                simple, modern way that feels right for everyone who visits us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal has always been to create a cozy atmosphere, respectful
                service, and clean, honest food that makes every guest feel at home. In
                time, we became known for our distinct taste and consistent quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are more than a restaurant—we are a space made with love, and we’d
                be honored for you to be part of it. Any success we’ve had has only
                ever been possible because of you.
